munge.py uses the Flickr API web service to munge the metadata for photos in the following way:

Given a single parameter, the photo set ID as input:

Iterate over every photo in the set, set the title to the title of the parent photo set and set the description
to a concatenation of basic EXIF data including: Camera make, model, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

To use:

easy_install flickrapi
easy_install pyyaml

python munge.py YOUR-PHOTSET-ID

The photo set id can be copied from the URL of the flickr photo set. That is, the right-most numeric part of the URL
not including the slashes:

So for this photoset:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidwatson/sets/72157627023466056/

THe photoset id is:

72157627023466056

and the script command line is:

python munge.py 72157627023466056

You also need to create a text file named api.yaml in the same directory as the script which contains two lines:

key : YOUR-KEY-GOES-HERE
secret : YOUR-SECRET-GOES-HERE
